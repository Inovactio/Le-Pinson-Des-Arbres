= Rules of the game

Rules : You can either be a Citizen, MrWhite or Undercover. All citizens will be assigned the same word while Undercover will be assigned a similar
one but different from the citizens' one. MrWhite is assigned no word.
When we create a lobby, we chose how many Undercover there will be in the game, how many maximum round the game will have and if we want to play
with a MrWhite or not.
Each round, each player will turn by turn write a word similar or that have any relation with the secret word. At the end of each room, players can
choose between skipping and hence starting a new round or vote to eliminate the imposter. If the latter is chosen, players can vote for the imposter
and who they think is Mr White. When the vote is over, the player who got the most votes is eliminated. Mr White then try to guess the Citizens' word.
If he's correct, he wins, otherwise if the Undercover is eliminated the Citizens win. Eventually, if no one or a citizen is eliminated the Undercover win.
